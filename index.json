Data provenance is a record of creation and modification of data. It has many uses, including scientific reproducibility, debugging, and establishing trust in data. The insight driving this project is that the core elements of the data environment (agents with access to the data; supplementary data which might be integrated with the data; infrastructure in which the data is stored and processed; and governance of the data) have the potential to be mapped with W3C PROV [3]. W3C PROV is an interoperability standard for provenance that defines the actors, entities, and activities which together created the dataset, and the relationships between them. Using PROV, we can map where data came from, and how they were processed. The objectives of this project are to:\rUndertake an analysis of modelling data environments, expressing terms as described in [1] using PROV concepts, including any domain-specific extensions to PROV that may be required to support this new usage.\rIdentify how to use provenance not only as a record of the development of the data, but also to help create contractual agreement in how data will be utilised after sharing, and how it can be used to support/comply with GDPR and other data privacy legislation.\rDetermine what improvements can be made to the operational power of the ADF by using the PROV representation.\rCollaborations:\rPlease refer project main website Task and Responsibilities:\rReasoning over provenance for analysing data situation in the data environments.\rTo Investigate models and approaches to automating and testing of compliance of data ethics, GDPR, etc.\rTo investigate Retrospective, Prospective, Prescriptive, Proscriptive provenance for expressing data situation and reasoning for anonymisation decisions.\r","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598918400,"objectID":"bfa788788a278b789d8bdd8f1452d8fd","permalink":"https://insyap.github.io/project/provanon/","publishdate":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/provanon/","section":"project","summary":"In this project we are investigating that how the use of  provenance formalisms will enable us to capture the necessary features of the complex dynamic data situations to allow more principled analysis of risk, the requirements of anonymisation and related topics such as Cyber Security, privacy and data utility.","tags":["PROVANON"],"title":"Provenance and Anonymisation (PROVANON)","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\rThe main innovative aspect of IoE data was to design and develop the infrastructure and middlewares for energy data sharing with linked data and ontologies.
